Software Development Phase Checklist

Project Setup

Finalize technology stack and tools.
Set up development environment (IDE, version control, CI/CD pipelines).
Create project repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).


Requirements Refinement

Review and finalize functional and non-functional requirements.
Document user stories or technical specifications.
Validate requirements with stakeholders.


Architecture and Design

Design system architecture (e.g., microservices, monolithic).
Create database schema and API specifications.
Develop wireframes or UI/UX mockups for user-facing components.


Development Sprints

Break work into sprints or iterations (e.g., Agile, Scrum).
Assign tasks to team members based on roles.
Implement core features and functionality for MVP.


Coding Standards

Define code style guidelines and best practices.
Use linters and formatters for consistency.
Implement code review processes.


Version Control

Use branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, feature branches).
Commit code regularly with clear messages.
Maintain documentation in the repository.


Testing

Write unit tests for critical components.
Perform integration and end-to-end testing.
Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.


Quality Assurance

Test for performance, scalability, and security.
Address bugs and issues promptly.
Ensure accessibility and usability standards are met.


Documentation

Document code (e.g., inline comments, README).
Create user guides or API documentation.
Maintain technical and onboarding docs for team.


Progress Tracking

Use project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello).
Monitor sprint progress and adjust priorities.
Report status to stakeholders regularly.


Security

Implement authentication and authorization.
Secure data storage and transmission (e.g., encryption).
Address vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).


Deployment Preparation

Set up staging and production environments.
Plan deployment strategy (e.g., rolling updates, blue-green).
Test deployment process in staging.


Feedback Integration

Gather feedback from early testing or beta users.
Prioritize and implement changes based on feedback.
Iterate on features as needed.


Team Collaboration

Hold regular standups or sync meetings.
Resolve blockers quickly.
Foster communication across roles (developers, designers, QA).


Risk Management

Monitor technical or schedule risks.
Adjust scope or timeline if needed.
Ensure compliance with legal or regulatory standards.
